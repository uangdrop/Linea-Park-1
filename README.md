This is now the fourth quest.

3-4. Galactic Exploration: Unlock Your Linea Travelbag

After raising City Hall to level 5
https://plat.metaapesgame.com/blindbox

 

MetaApes
 
plat.metaapesgame.com


After accessing the above site,


Just mint the City Starter above.
 
The game doesn't work well... so work on it when you can!
 


As shown here, a bonus is also available if City Hall is level 8.

3-6. The Unfettered Quest
 
This is the last quest of week 1.


Just download the game, play for about 5 minutes, and get a Voyager's Odyssey NFT.
https://store.hyperplay.xyz/game/theunfettered

 

The Unfettered | HyperPlay | Web3 Game Store
Genre-defying soulslike RPG with stunning graphics, powered by true ownership of blockchain.
store.hyperplay.xyz


You can download the game and play it, but the size is 16GB... I wonder if I really need to download it haha..
 


You can play through all of these options to obtain them!


Then I passed 3-5 because I couldn't play the game and completed the rest!

4. VIP Zone


This is the final VIP Zone.


There is nothing special here, and if you have obtained the previous testnet Voyage or have an LXP score of 1700 or more, you can think of it as a place where you can receive additional LXP benefits as Tier 1.
 
When the eligible person enters, their VIP Rank will indicate whether they are Tier 1 or 2, and they can redeem their ticket.
You can think of this ticket as a bonus that allows you to earn double LXP.

This completes the 1st week Linea quest.
Actually, it's a game, so it's a bit annoying to download and play... haha, but LXP will be added as Linea's token later, so I hope you don't miss it!
 
This concludes week 1, and I’ll see you next week for week 2~~
